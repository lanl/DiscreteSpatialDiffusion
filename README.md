This repository contains the official implementation of *Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD)*, a diffusion modeling framework designed to preserve intensity in the forward and reverse processes. 

The development of the manuscript and codebase was supported by FY24 Laboratory Directed Research and Development program project *Diffusion Modeling with Physical Constraints for Scientific Data* (20240074ER).
